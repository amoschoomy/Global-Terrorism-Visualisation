    An alarming high percentage of <b id="suc">89%</b> was recorded as successful terrorist attack while only <b id="fail">11%</b> of terrorist attacks are foiled.
    <br>
    Authorities needs to take charge to decrease the number of successful terrorist attacks because 
    the lesser the number of succesful terrorist attacks, the lesser the number of casualities recorded

    Terrorism comes in many form mostly causing physical harm to humans and/or infrastructures,
    so here are some of the methodolgies of terrorism studied and visualised.
    <br><br>
    Bombing is the most common methodology of attack with <b>88000</b> of terrorism cases reported
    are due to bombing.
    <br><br>
    Even more fascinating, the rest of the terrorism methodology combined only amounts to about <b>93000</b>
    cases which is barely higher than terrorist attacks conducted through bombing.
